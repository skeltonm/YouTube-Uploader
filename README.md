# YouTube-Uploader

This project was created based on code samples from YouTube's Python API documentation with adjustments made to enable mass uploads using a CSV metadata file.

To use, add you own OAuth credentials and add the videos you would like to upload to files.csv.  Then you can invoke the script using the code below

```bash
python youtube.py
```
